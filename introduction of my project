1. Introduction
1.1 Description & Discussion of the Background
Canada is an immigrant country, and many new immigrants land in various cities every year. For new immigrants, how to choose a reasonable place to live in the city is very critical. Among them, children â€™s education, commuting time, crime rate, cost of living (house prices, rent) and other factors must be considered.Therefore, I plan to use Toronto as an example to analyze the characteristics of different living areas to help new immigrants choose a reasonable living environment
1.2 Problem
Data that affecting the living environment include house prices, rents, population density, education level, crime rate, work opportunities and other factors. This project mainly evaluates different living areas through the analysis of these factors.

1.3 Interest
Obviously, new immigrants, real-estate companies and some builders are interested the characteristics of different living areas for the personal advantage and business values. Other related service industries such as restaurants will also be interested in the analysis results.
